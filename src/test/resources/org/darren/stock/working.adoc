The Untracked Child Locations feature represents areas within a broader inventory location hierarchy where stock can be placed but not individually tracked for movements. While these child locations do not record the movement of inventory within them, they are crucial for several operational and logistical purposes.

The objective of this feature is to provide structured metadata about potential stock placements, support inventory management processes, and improve the overall efficiency of stock-related operations.

The Untracked Child Locations feature ensures that:

* Possible locations for products within a parent location are clearly identified.
* Stock assertions (e.g., "no stock in this location" or "low stock") can be captured at the child location level.
* Stock counting processes are enhanced by identifying locations for verification.
* The capacity of each location to hold stock is documented.

=== Characteristics of Untracked Child Locations

Untracked child locations serve as logical sub-divisions of a parent location. Common examples include areas like shelves, aisles, and display units within a retail store or zones within a warehouse. The following aspects are associated with these locations:

* *Parent-Child Relationship*: Child locations are hierarchically linked to a parent location.
* *Capacity Management*: The storage capacity for each location is defined.
* *Stock Assertions*: Observations about stock levels can be recorded even without movement tracking.
* *Inventory Counting*: Locations can be included in stocktake processes.

=== Importance of Untracked Child Locations

Untracked child locations add value to inventory management by:

* Enhancing visibility of stock distribution within a parent location.
* Supporting operational tasks like replenishment planning and capacity assessment.
* Providing structured data for stock counting and verification processes.

| Use Case Category           | Description
| Product Discovery           a| * Indicating potential locations where products may be found.
| Inventory Assertions        a| * Recording observations such as "no stock" or "low stock" at specific child locations.
| Stock take Support          a| * Identifying locations to be included in inventory counting processes.
| Capacity Planning           a| * Documenting the maximum stock each child location can hold to support replenishment and allocation planning.

=== Key Elements of Untracked Child Locations

Untracked child locations include the following details:

* *Name and Description*: A unique identifier and description for the child location.
* *Parent Location*: The higher-level location that the child location belongs to.
* *Capacity*: The maximum amount of stock the location can hold.
* *Assertions*: Any statements or observations about the stock level in the location.

=== Purpose

The Untracked Child Locations feature supports the following objectives:

* Enhancing inventory visibility within untracked areas of the supply chain.
* Improving accuracy in stock counting and verification processes.
* Facilitating operational planning and replenishment decisions.

This functionality empowers organisations to manage inventory more effectively by recognising and utilising the full range of available storage and display areas.

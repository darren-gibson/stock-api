=== Get Stock Level for Product at Location Endpoint Specification

The Get Stock Level for Product at Location endpoint provides real-time visibility into the inventory of products in locations. This functionality is essential for maintaining accurate inventory data and supporting operational decisions.

The endpoint supports both tracked and untracked locations:

- **Tracked Locations:** Stock levels are directly associated with the location, the response can optionally include the the aggregated view of all tracked child locations.
- **Untracked Locations:** Untracked locations do not maintain their own `quantity` therefore the result is the aggregated view of all tracked child locations.

The response includes a `pendingAdjustment` field, representing any known discrepancies between the recorded stock and actual stock for tracked locations. This field is omitted for untracked locations.

==== Key Points

- **Aggregated Stock:** the `totalQuantity` represents the sum of all tracked child locations' `quantity`.
- **Quantity and Untracked Locations:** For untracked locations, the `quantity` and `pendingAdjustment` fields are omitted as stock is not maintained at these locations.
- **Child Location Details:** For both tracked and untracked locations, the response optionally includes stock details for child locations.
- **Pending Adjustment:** The `pendingAdjustment` field is included only for tracked locations and does not affect `totalQuantity`.

==== Notes

- **Untracked Location Behavior:** Untracked locations do not maintain a `quantity` field. Instead, `totalQuantity` represents the aggregate stock across all tracked child locations.
- **Tracked Location Behavior:** Tracked locations include both `quantity` and `totalQuantity`, with `pendingAdjustment` for stock discrepancies.
- **Empty Child Locations for Untracked Locations:** If no tracked child locations exist, `totalQuantity` is `0`, and `childLocations` is an empty array.
